\title{DAME-package:  Marginal Effects in Nonlinear Interactive Models.}
\description{
The DAME package provides tools that implement and visualize the procedures described in Moral, Sedashov
and Zhirnov (2017). It can also be used for computing other well-known quantities of interest such
as predicted probabilities.
